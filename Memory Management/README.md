The goal of this project is to simulate the paging scheme in memory management. 
The tester code is provided in Factory.java and MemoryThread.java.  
5 threads are created and each requests for a certain number of pages (simulates loading a new process into memory), then accesses a certain 
page (simulates referencing a logical address), and then releases the requested memory (simulates terminating a process).
